How should the map info be laid out?

idea 1: layers:
  - background layer, (grass and dirt)
  - terrain layer layer (path blocking), (water, rocks, cliffs?)
  - entity layer (path blocking), (trees, mines, buildings)
  - unit layer?, (moving units)
  if background tile is not nil or >0 it is walkable
  if terrain or entity tile is nil or 0 it is walkable
